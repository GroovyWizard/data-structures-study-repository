1. How many steps would it take to perform a linear search for the number
8 in the ordered array, [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13]?
R: 4 steps


2. How many steps would binary search take for the previous example?
R: 1 step, because the array has 7 elements, therefore starting on the middle would instantly find our desired element (8)

3. What is the maximum number of steps it would take to perform a binary
search on an array of size 100,000?
R:

The question is HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO DIVIDE 100000 TO 2 TO GET 1?

This is the (Log base 2 of n) binary logarithm!

Is this case Log2 of 100000
