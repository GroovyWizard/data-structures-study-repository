1. Use Big O Notation to describe the time complexity of an algorithm that
takes 4N + 16 steps.

R: O(N) (Since we drop the constant steps)

2. Use Big O Notation to describe the time complexity of an algorithm that
takes 2N^2.

R: O(N²) (Dropping the constants)


3. Use Big O Notation to describe the time complexity of the following func-
tion, which returns the sum of all numbers of an array after the numbers
have been doubled:

R: O(N) (2N with the constants)

4. Use Big O Notation to describe the time complexity of the following func-
tion, which accepts an array of strings and prints each string in multiple
cases:

O(N)

5. The next function iterates over an array of numbers, and for each number
whose index is even, it prints the sum of that number plus every number
in the array. What is this function’s efficiency in terms of Big O Notation?

R: O(N²) (after dropping the constants)
