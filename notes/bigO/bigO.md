Asking for a Big O roughly means:
*if there are N data elements, how
many steps will the algorithm take?*


**CONSTRASTING**:

Linear search that takes steps equivalent to the number of elements:
O(N) Big O of N


**THE SOUL OF BIG O**:
How will an algorithm’s performance change as the data increases?

It tells you about
the proportional relationship between the data and the algorithm’s efficiency.
It describes exactly how the number of steps increase as the data increases.

**SMALL SCALE ALGORITHMS**:
Algorithms that take very little steps

"Viewed with this lens, we don’t care very much whether an algorithm is O(1) or
O(3). Because both algorithms are the type that aren’t affected by increased
data, as their number of steps remain constant, they’re essentially the same
kind of algorithm. They’re both algorithms whose steps remain constant irre-
spective of the data, and we don’t care to make a distinction between the two."

**SCENARIOS**:

Example linear search, in the Best Case Scenario (which the element we are searching is in the first index) then its complexity will be O(1)!

But the worst case will be O(N)...
