**LOGARITHMS**

- Roughly the inverse of exponents, example:
2^3 = 8

Log2 8 = How many times do i have to multiply 2 by itself to get 8?
3!

So Log2 8 = 3

- Example 2:

2^6 = 64

Log2 64 = How many times do i have to multiply 2 by itself to get 64?
6!

So Log2 64 = 6

**IMPORTANT**

- Another awesome way to understand Logarithms of base 2 is:

Log2 8

How many times do i have to divide 8 by itself to get 1?

8 / 2 / 2 / 2 = 1
So 3!

**But Why O(Log N)**
Here its the same as saying O(Log2 N) since the base is always two we omit it!

**WHAT DOES IT MEAN???**
O(log N) means the algorithm takes as many steps as it takes to
keep halving the data elements until we remain with 1!
