Given an array of unsorted values, how can we sort them so that they end up
in ascending order??
One of the ways is bubble sort which consists in comparing two elements until the array is completely sorted!


NAME:
This is actually the reason why this algorithm is called Bubble Sort: in each
pass-through, the highest unsorted value “bubbles” up to its correct position.

EFFICIENCY:
Bubble Sort in the worst case scenario is a case of O(n^2) exponential! QUADRATIC!
