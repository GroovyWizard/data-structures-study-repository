ONLY WORKS WITHIN AN ORDERED ARRAY!

In this example we are looking for the number SEVEN (7) in an array with NINE (9) elements.

1- Start from the central element (get array size and divide by 2)

2- We found 9!

3- Now lets get half of this index, the second element, and we found 4

4- Now we know 7 is between 4 and 9

5- Checking two elements to the right we find 6 and 7, if its not here, then theres no 7 inside the array!

About the time complexity:

Theres a pattern that the time complexity in the binary search (ordered array) is always

O(Log n)

LOGARITHM = How many times you need to elevate the Base to get N
